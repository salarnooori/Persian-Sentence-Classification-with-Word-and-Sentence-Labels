# Persian Sentence Classification with Word and Sentence Labels

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying Persian sentences using a labeled dataset. The notebook guides you through the steps required to preprocess the data, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance. The goal is to predict the class of each sentence using both word-level and sentence-level features.

## Notebook Structure
-Environment Setup: Install and import the necessary libraries.
-Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the dataset, including tokenization and feature extraction.
-Model Training: Train a machine learning model on the processed data.
-Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using various metrics.
Usage

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- transformers
- torch

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn transformers torch
